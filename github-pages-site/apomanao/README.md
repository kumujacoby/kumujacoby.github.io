## Design Principles

ʻApomanaʻo follows five core design principles that emerged from conversations with Hawaiian educators:

1. **Digital Minimalism** - No shame-inducing metrics or gamification
2. **Cultural Manipulatives** - Tools function as digital teaching aids
3. **Authentic Hawaiian Thinking** - Technology that honors Hawaiian ways of knowing
4. **Community Ownership** - Built with basic web technologies anyone can modify
5. **Invisible Interface** - The culture, not the technology, takes center stage
